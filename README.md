# Churn-Modelling-using-ANN
Employing TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and ANN, this project predicts customer churn in a banking context. Robust preprocessing, a two-layer ANN architecture, and in-depth evaluation metrics provide a comprehensive tool for understanding and mitigating customer attrition. Open for contributions and enhancements.

**Overview:**
This project employs Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to forecast customer churn in a banking context. Leveraging TensorFlow and scikit-learn, it encompasses robust data preprocessing, ANN model development, and comprehensive evaluation metrics, aiding in insightful performance analysis.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Utilizes LabelEncoder for categorical feature encoding.
   - Implements OneHotEncoder for categorical feature expansion.
   - Standardizes numerical features using StandardScaler for optimal model training.

2. **ANN Architecture:**
   - Adopts a Sequential model structure.
   - Employs two hidden layers activated by Rectified Linear Units (ReLU).
   - Configures binary crossentropy loss function and Adam optimizer for binary classification.

3. **Prediction and Evaluation:**
   - Predicts the probability of customer churn for given input data.
   - Evaluates model accuracy through a comprehensive confusion matrix.
   - Incorporates accuracy score calculation for further performance assessment.

**Usage:**

1. Run the Python script for seamless execution.
2. Fine-tune hyperparameters as needed for model optimization.
3. Analyze the confusion matrix to gauge the model's effectiveness.
4. Employ the trained model for making accurate predictions on customer churn.

**Contributions:**
Contributions, whether in the form of issues, feedback, or pull requests, are encouraged to enhance the project's functionality and robustness.

**Tools and Libraries:**
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn.
